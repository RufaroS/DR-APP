# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection using Deep Learning

This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) for automated detection of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) from retinal fundus images. The goal is to support early screening and improve diagnostic access in low-resource healthcare settings.

## Project Summary

Diabetic Retinopathy is one of the leading causes of preventable blindness. Early diagnosis significantly reduces the risk of vision loss, but specialist equipment is limited in many regions.  
This project applies deep learning to classify retinal images by DR severity, providing a low-cost decision-support tool for preliminary screening.
